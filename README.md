# Memory Game - Inspired by Nickelodeon's Brain Surge

## Overview
This is a memory game based on the popular Nickelodeon Brain Surge memory square game. The objective of the game is to remember and match the correct path generated by the CPU. The game continues with increasing difficulty levels until the user makes a mistake. High scores are stored in the local storage and will update if the user beats the current high score.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
   - The game will display a grid of squares.

2. **CPU Path:**
   - The CPU will flash a sequence of squares in a specific path.
   - Pay close attention to the sequence as you will need to replicate it.

3. **User Input:**
   - Click on the squares in the same sequence as the CPU showed.
   - Each click will be highlighted with a flash and a sound.

4. **Submitting Your Sequence:**
   - Once you have selected the squares in the correct sequence, click the "Submit" button.
   - The game will compare your sequence with the CPU's sequence.

5. **Level Completion:**
   - If your sequence matches the CPU's sequence, the board will light up green, indicating that you have passed the level.
   - Click the "Next" button to proceed to the next level with an increased grid size and difficulty.

6. **Game Over:**
   - If your sequence does not match the CPU's sequence, the board will flash red, indicating that you have lost.
   - The "Reset" button will appear, allowing you to start a new game.

7. **High Scores:**
   - High scores are tracked and displayed on the screen.
   - The high score is stored in the local storage and will update if you achieve a higher score than the current high score.
